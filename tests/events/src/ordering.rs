//! Event ordering and payload privacy.
//!
//! ## Ordering
//!
//! Every entry point in this workspace publishes at most one event, so ordering
//! *within* an invocation is trivially deterministic. What an indexer actually
//! needs to know is the ordering *across* a multi-step operator sequence, and
//! that it is the ledger — not the contract — which fixes it.
//!
//! One consequence of the test environment is worth recording, because it
//! shapes how these tests are written: `env.events().all()` reports the events
//! of the most recent invocation only. A sequence therefore has to be observed
//! step by step; the stream cannot be replayed after the fact.
//!
//! ## Privacy
//!
//! Contracts store hashes, never the values behind them. The payload assertions
//! below are what keeps that true as events evolve: an event carrying an amount
//! or an identity would leak to every indexer on the network, permanently.
