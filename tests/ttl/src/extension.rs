//! Extension-trigger boundaries.
//!
//! `extend_ttl(threshold, extend_to)` is a one-sided bump: the host rewrites
//! the entry's live-until ledger only when the remaining TTL is *at or below*
//! the threshold, and only when the new live-until is further out than the old
//! one. Both halves of that rule are pinned here, because a contract that
//! extended unconditionally would rewrite an entry on every read and pay rent
//! it does not owe, while one that never extended would silently archive.
