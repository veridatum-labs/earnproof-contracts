//! What "a dependency update racing with a registration" means on this ledger.
//!
//! # The concurrency model
//!
//! Soroban applies the transactions in a ledger **sequentially**. There is no
//! concurrency within a ledger, and no interleaving within an invocation. Three
//! consequences settle every race question this issue raises, and none of them
//! involve timing:
//!
//! 1. A cross-contract read observes the state left by every transaction
//!    applied before the current one, and nothing that lands after. A
//!    registration cannot observe half of an update.
//! 2. `register_proof` reads each dependency exactly once and never re-reads.
//!    The values observed at boundaries 1-3 are the values that decide the
//!    write, and nothing can change between them.
//! 3. A failed invocation is rolled back in full, including any state a
//!    dependency changed while it ran.
//!
//! So a "race" is only ever an **ordering**: the last update applied before the
//! registration is the one it sees, and an update applied after it cannot reach
//! back. The tests below are written as orderings for that reason. There are no
//! sleeps here because there is nothing for a sleep to wait on.
//!
//! The one situation the ledger cannot produce — a dependency changing *during*
//! the invocation — is constructed artificially with
//! [`crate::mocks::SelfPausingConfig`], so that the third consequence above is
//! asserted rather than assumed.
