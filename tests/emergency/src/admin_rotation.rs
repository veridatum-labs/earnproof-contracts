//! Administrator authority during an incident.
//!
//! Two failure modes are modelled here, both of which turn a recoverable
//! incident into an unrecoverable one:
//!
//! * **Privilege retention** — a rotated-out administrator keeps the ability to
//!   change pause state, so containment can be undone by the party the rotation
//!   was meant to remove.
//! * **Silent stranding** — rotation succeeds against an address that can never
//!   authorise, leaving a paused contract with no one able to unpause it. The
//!   contract must not accept such a change without it being observable.
