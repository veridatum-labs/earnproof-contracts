//! The authoritative inventory of on-chain storage namespaces.
//!
//! Each contract keeps its own private `DataKey` enum, which is what actually
//! addresses ledger entries. This module is the reviewed description of those
//! enums: one entry per `DataKey` variant, recording which contract owns it,
//! how many payload fields it carries, which durability class it belongs to,
//! what it stores, and who is responsible for it.
//!
//! The inventory is not decorative. `tests/storage-keys/` drives a full
//! lifecycle across all three contracts and compares the namespaces that
//! actually appear in instance, persistent, and temporary storage against
//! [`STORAGE_NAMESPACES`]. A new `DataKey` variant, a renamed one, or one
//! written to the wrong durability class fails that comparison.
//!
//! ## Why namespaces cannot collide
//!
//! A `#[contracttype]` enum encodes as a vector whose first element is the
//! variant name as a `Symbol` and whose remaining elements are the payload
//! fields in declaration order. Two consequences follow, and both are asserted
//! in `tests/storage-keys/`:
//!
//! * Two variants with different names never produce the same key, whatever
//!   their payloads, because the discriminant symbol differs in the first
//!   position. There is no concatenation step in which a payload could be
//!   mistaken for a discriminant.
//! * Two variants with the same name and different arity never produce the
//!   same key, because the encoded vectors have different lengths.
//!
//! Ledger keys are additionally scoped by contract address, so the same
//! namespace name in two different contracts addresses two different entries.
//!
//! See [`docs/storage.md`](../../../docs/storage.md) for the prose version of
//! this inventory, including the rules for adding a namespace.

/// Durability class of a storage entry.

/// The three classes are not interchangeable. Instance entries share one
/// lifetime with the contract itself and are read on nearly every call, so
/// they suit small configuration values. Persistent entries carry an
/// independent per-key lifetime and suit records that must outlive any single
/// deployment concern. Temporary entries cannot be restored once they expire,
/// which makes them unsuitable for anything a verifier may need later.
