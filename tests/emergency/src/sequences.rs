//! Generated operation sequences.
//!
//! The matrix in [`crate::pause_matrix`] checks one operation at a time against
//! a known state. This module checks the *orderings*: every permutation of a
//! small emergency alphabet is replayed against a fresh deployment, and the
//! resulting state is compared against an independent model of what the
//! documented rules say should have happened.
//!
//! The generator is exhaustive rather than random. The alphabet is small enough
//! that every ordering up to a bounded length can be enumerated, which gives a
//! deterministic, reproducible suite — a failing case names an exact sequence
//! rather than a seed.
