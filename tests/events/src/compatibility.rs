//! Event topic and payload evolution.
//!
//! `tests/event-fixtures/` validates that the JSON fixtures are well-formed.
//! What it cannot check is whether they still describe the contracts: a fixture
//! is a static file, and nothing stops the two from drifting apart.
//!
//! These tests close that gap by comparing live emissions against the fixtures.
//! A renamed topic or a dropped payload field fails here, which is what makes
//! the fixtures usable as a compatibility contract for indexers rather than
//! documentation that happened to be true once.
