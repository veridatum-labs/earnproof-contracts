//! Pause behaviour for every public read and mutation.
//!
//! The table below is the executable form of the "Behaviour under pause" section
//! of `docs/emergency-operations.md`. Each entry names one public entry point
//! and records whether it is expected to remain available while the protocol is
//! paused.
//!
//! Every case is driven through the generated `try_*` client methods, which
//! surface a rejected invocation as `Err` instead of unwinding. That lets one
//! table assert both the "available" and "contained" expectations, and lets a
//! scenario keep using the deployment after a rejected call — which is what the
//! ordering and recovery assertions depend on.
