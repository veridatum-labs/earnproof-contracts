//! Invalid, stale, and version-incompatible dependency references.
//!
//! `proof-registry` fixes both dependency addresses at `initialize` and exposes
//! no way to change them. `initialize` does not check that anything is deployed
//! at either address, or that what *is* deployed answers the calls
//! `register_proof` will make. Every one of those mistakes therefore surfaces
//! for the first time inside a registration, which is the worst moment for it
//! to be ambiguous.
//!
//! The invariant this module protects is that all of them fail **closed**: a
//! reference that cannot be resolved, cannot be understood, or no longer
//! describes the caller must reject the registration, never wave it through.
