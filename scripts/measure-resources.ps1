# Measure contract WASM sizes and report potential regressions.
#
# This script builds all contracts in release mode and measures their
# optimized WASM sizes. Size increases may indicate unnecessary code
# bloat or unintended dependencies.
#
# Thresholds include 10% headroom above baseline measurements.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/measure-resources.ps1
#
# To update baselines after intentional changes:
# 1. Review the size changes and ensure they are justified
# 2. Update the MAX_SIZE constants below
# 3. Document the change in the PR description
