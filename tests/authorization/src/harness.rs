//! Shared fixtures for the authorization negative matrix.
//!
//! Unlike the emergency harness, this harness does **not** call
//! `mock_all_auths`. Every privileged call is authorized explicitly through
//! [`authorize`], which installs a *matching-mode* auth entry: the host admits
//! the next invocation only when the demanded signer, function, and arguments
//! match the entry exactly, and rejects everything else. That enforcement is
//! what lets the matrix assert both the returned error and the absence of side
//! effects for missing and wrong identities.
//!
//! The deployment is the full three-contract set so that cross-contract
//! authorization boundaries (`proof-registry`'s issuer-vs-admin revocation
//! paths, independent per-contract admins) can be exercised from one place.
