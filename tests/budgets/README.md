# Resource Budget Regression Tests

This directory contains resource budget regression tests for EarnProof Soroban contracts.

## Purpose

These tests measure CPU instructions, memory usage, and WASM sizes for representative operations to detect performance regressions that could:
- Make mainnet operations unexpectedly expensive
- Exceed Soroban resource limits
- Degrade user experience with slow transactions

## Test Coverage

### Protocol Config Contract
- `initialize` - Initial contract setup
- `pause` - Protocol pause operation
- `approve_schema_version` - Schema approval with persistent storage

### Issuer Registry Contract
- `initialize` - Initial contract setup
- `register_issuer` - New issuer registration (worst case: dual index writes)
- `get_issuer` - Issuer lookup with TTL extension
- `update_issuer` - Metadata update operation
- `suspend_issuer` - Status transition to Suspended
- `revoke_issuer` - Status transition to Revoked (terminal)
- `rotate_issuer_address` - Address rotation with index updates

### Proof Registry Contract
- `initialize` - Initial contract setup with cross-contract references
- `register_proof` - Proof registration with cross-contract validation (worst case)
- `get_proof` - Proof lookup with TTL extension
- `revoke_proof` - Proof revocation
- `is_valid_proof` - Validity check including expiration

## Resource Metrics

### CPU Instructions
Measures computational cost of operations. Soroban charges fees based on CPU usage.

### Memory Bytes
Measures memory footprint during operation execution. High memory usage increases costs.

### WASM Size
Measured by `scripts/measure-resources.ps1`. Larger WASM size:
- Increases deployment costs
- May hit size limits
- Suggests unnecessary dependencies or code bloat

## Thresholds

All thresholds include headroom above current baseline measurements:
- **CPU/Memory**: ~20% headroom for normal variance
- **WASM size**: ~10% headroom to allow reasonable growth

Thresholds are intentionally conservative to force explicit review of resource changes.

## Baseline Environment

Measurements taken on:
- **Soroban SDK**: v27.0.0
- **Rust toolchain**: Stable, as pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`
- **Target**: wasm32v1-none
- **Build profile**: release with overflow-checks=true

## Running Tests

### Run budget tests only:
```bash
cargo test -p resource-budget-tests
```

### Run with output to see actual measurements:
```bash
cargo test -p resource-budget-tests -- --nocapture
```

### Measure WASM sizes:
```pwsh
./scripts/measure-resources.ps1
```

**Note**: WASM size measurement requires building contracts for the `wasm32v1-none` target in release mode. Due to Soroban SDK v27.0.0 requirements, this requires Rust 1.84 or newer. The script is provided for local testing but is not currently enforced in CI.

### Verbose WASM measurement:
```pwsh
./scripts/measure-resources.ps1 -Verbose
```

## Updating Baselines

When tests fail after intentional changes:

1. **Review the change**: Understand why resource usage increased
2. **Justify the change**: Document the reason (new feature, security fix, etc.)
3. **Update thresholds**: 
   - For CPU/memory: Update constants in `tests/budgets/src/lib.rs`
   - For WASM size: Update constants in `scripts/measure-resources.ps1`
4. **Document in PR**: Explain the resource impact and justification

### Example: Adding a new feature

If adding a new validation check increases `register_proof` CPU from 650K to 750K:

```rust
// In tests/budgets/src/lib.rs
- const PROOF_REGISTER_CPU_MAX: u64 = 800_000;  // Old (650K + 20% headroom)
+ const PROOF_REGISTER_CPU_MAX: u64 = 900_000;  // New (750K + 20% headroom)
```

PR description should include:
```markdown
## Resource Impact

- `proof_registry.register_proof` CPU increased from 650K to 750K instructions
- Reason: Added issuer revocation status check for extra security
- New threshold: 900K (includes 20% headroom)
- Mainnet cost impact: Negligible (~$0.001 increase per proof registration)
```

## Regression Detection

Two tests deliberately exceed thresholds to prove gates work:
- `budget_gate_detects_cpu_regression` - Fails with artificially low CPU limit
- `budget_gate_detects_memory_regression` - Fails with artificially low memory limit

These tests use `#[should_panic]` to expect failure.

## CI Integration

Resource budget tests run automatically in CI on every PR:
- Budget tests execute via `cargo test --workspace`
- WASM size checks can be added to CI workflow if needed

## Optimization Guidelines

If tests fail due to genuine regressions:

1. **Profile the operation**: Use `cargo flamegraph` or Soroban profiling tools
2. **Check for**:
   - Unnecessary clones or allocations
   - Redundant storage reads
   - Inefficient data structures
   - Unintended debug code left in release builds
3. **Common optimizations**:
   - Use references instead of clones
   - Batch storage operations
   - Cache frequently-accessed data
   - Remove unnecessary validations

## Security Considerations

**Do not weaken security to pass budget tests**:
- ✅ Optimize data structures
- ✅ Reduce redundant operations
- ✅ Improve algorithms
- ❌ Skip authorization checks
- ❌ Remove TTL extensions
- ❌ Disable validation logic

If a security-critical operation is expensive, increase the threshold and document why.

## Network Assumptions

These tests measure resource usage in the Soroban test environment. Actual mainnet costs depend on:
- Network congestion
- Stellar network parameters
- Soroban fee market dynamics

Tests ensure operations stay well below hard limits, providing safety margin for mainnet variability.

## Maintenance

- **Review quarterly**: Check if thresholds need adjustment as SDK evolves
- **Update on SDK upgrades**: Re-baseline after major Soroban SDK updates
- **Track trends**: Monitor if resource usage grows over time without feature additions

## Support

If budget tests fail unexpectedly:
1. Check recent changes for unintended performance impact
2. Run tests with `--nocapture` to see exact measurements
3. Compare measurements against thresholds to understand magnitude
4. Review [Soroban resource documentation](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/resource-limits-fees)
