# Backend Integration

This document lists the contract calls the EarnProof API should use when writing proof commitments, reading issuer status, and validating public proof state.

## Protocol Config

Contract responsibility:

- Store protocol administrator.
- Store pause state.
- Store approved schema versions.
- Expose a configuration version counter.

Backend reads:

```text
get_admin() -> Address
is_paused() -> bool
is_schema_version_approved(version: u32) -> bool
get_config_version() -> u32
```

Backend writes:

```text
approve_schema_version(version: u32)
deprecate_schema_version(version: u32)
pause()
unpause()
```

Admin authorization is required for writes.

## Issuer Registry

Contract responsibility:

- Store approved issuer records.
- Store issuer status.
- Store public metadata hash.
- Rotate issuer wallet addresses.
- Resolve issuer records by ID hash or Stellar address.

Backend reads:

```text
get_issuer(issuer_id_hash: BytesN<32>) -> IssuerRecord
get_issuer_by_address(issuer_address: Address) -> IssuerRecord
is_active_issuer(issuer_id_hash: BytesN<32>) -> bool
is_active_address(issuer_address: Address) -> bool
```

Backend writes:

```text
register_issuer(issuer_id_hash: BytesN<32>, issuer_address: Address, metadata_hash: BytesN<32>)
update_issuer(issuer_id_hash: BytesN<32>, metadata_hash: BytesN<32>)
suspend_issuer(issuer_id_hash: BytesN<32>)
reactivate_issuer(issuer_id_hash: BytesN<32>)
revoke_issuer(issuer_id_hash: BytesN<32>)
rotate_issuer_address(issuer_id_hash: BytesN<32>, new_address: Address)
```

Admin authorization is required for writes.

## Proof Registry

Contract responsibility:

- Store proof commitment records.
- Reject duplicate proof IDs.
- Reject expired proof registrations.
- Revoke proof records.
- Expose issuer registry and protocol config contract references.

Backend reads:

```text
get_proof(proof_id_hash: BytesN<32>) -> ProofRecord
is_valid_proof(proof_id_hash: BytesN<32>) -> bool
is_revoked(proof_id_hash: BytesN<32>) -> bool
get_issuer_registry() -> Address
get_protocol_config() -> Address
```

Backend writes:

```text
register_proof(
  proof_id_hash: BytesN<32>,
  commitment_hash: BytesN<32>,
  issuer_address: Address,
  schema_version: u32,
  expires_at: u64
)
revoke_proof(proof_id_hash: BytesN<32>)
admin_revoke_proof(proof_id_hash: BytesN<32>)
```

Issuer authorization is required for normal proof registration and revocation. Admin authorization is required for administrative revocation.

## Hashing Rules

The backend should hash public identifiers before passing them to contracts:

```text
proof_id_hash = sha256(proof_id)
issuer_id_hash = sha256(issuer_id)
commitment_hash = sha256(canonical_credential_payload_without_signature)
metadata_hash = sha256(canonical_public_issuer_metadata)
```

## On-Chain Data Boundary

Do not send exact income, raw transaction lists, personal names, emails, or full wallet history to contracts. Store only hashes, status, schema version, issuer address, expiration, and timestamps.
