//! Fixtures, rejection classification, and the state footprint the scenarios
//! assert on.
//!
//! # The registration path
//!
//! `register_proof` performs these steps, in this order. The numbered rows are
//! the cross-contract read boundaries; everything else is local to
//! `proof-registry`.
//!
//! | Step | What happens                                            |
//! |------|---------------------------------------------------------|
//! | A    | `issuer_address.require_auth()`                         |
//! | B    | reject `schema_version == 0`                            |
//! | C    | reject `expires_at <= now`                              |
//! | D    | read the `ProtocolConfig` reference from instance storage |
//! | **1**| `protocol-config::is_paused() -> bool`                   |
//! | **2**| `protocol-config::is_schema_version_approved(u32) -> bool` |
//! | E    | read the `IssuerRegistry` reference from instance storage |
//! | **3**| `issuer-registry::is_active_address(Address) -> bool`    |
//! | F    | reject a duplicate `Proof(proof_id_hash)` key            |
//! | G    | write the record and extend its TTL                     |
//!
//! Steps A–C give "before the first read", boundaries 1–3 give "during a
//! read", and E–G give "after a read". [`crate::mocks`] supplies substitute
//! dependencies that fail at a chosen boundary, which is what makes the
//! ordering above observable from outside rather than merely asserted.
//!
//! # Reading state without disturbing it
//!
//! Almost every public read in this workspace extends a TTL — `get_proof`,
//! `get_issuer`, and `is_schema_version_approved` all do. A snapshot built from
//! those getters could not distinguish "the failed call extended the TTL" from
//! "the snapshot did". [`Deployment::footprint`] therefore reads the entries
//! whose TTL it asserts on straight out of storage through
//! [`soroban_sdk::Env::as_contract`], which extends nothing.
