# Deployment Scripts

These scripts provide a reproducible Stellar testnet deployment path for the EarnProof Soroban contracts.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml`
- `wasm32v1-none` target support from Rust `1.84.0` or newer
- Stellar CLI available as `stellar`
- A funded Stellar testnet identity configured in Stellar CLI
- No secret keys committed to the repository

## Build and Deploy

```powershell
.\scripts\deploy-testnet.ps1 -Source deployer -Admin G... -IssuerAddress G... -Output scripts\deployment-manifest.testnet.json
```

By default, Stellar CLI deploy and invoke calls are retried up to five times for transient RPC transport failures such as connection resets, send failures, timeouts, temporary unavailability, and sequence races. Override this with `-MaxRetries` when needed:

```powershell
.\scripts\deploy-testnet.ps1 -Source deployer -Admin G... -IssuerAddress G... -MaxRetries 8
```

The script:

- installs the `wasm32v1-none` target if needed;
- builds optimized release WASM artifacts with `stellar contract build`;
- deploys `protocol-config`, `issuer-registry`, and `proof-registry`;
- initializes each contract;
- approves schema version `1`;
- registers the backend issuer address before proof anchoring is enabled;
- writes a manifest with contract IDs, WASM hashes, admin address, schema versions, and CLI command evidence.

## Verify Manifest

```powershell
.\scripts\verify-manifest.ps1 -Manifest scripts\deployment-manifest.testnet.json
```

For the checked-in example manifest:

```powershell
.\scripts\verify-manifest.ps1 -Manifest scripts\deployment-manifest.example.json -AllowPlaceholders
```

The verifier checks the manifest shape and rejects placeholder contract IDs unless `-AllowPlaceholders` is explicitly supplied.
