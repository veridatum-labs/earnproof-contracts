# Contract compatibility policy

How a change to a contract artifact is classified, what a release must record,
and what a breaking change requires before it ships.

Consumers — the EarnProof backend, indexers, and any third party reading the
registries — need to know when an artifact changes behaviour they depend on.
Without a stated policy, "we changed a contract" and "we broke your integration"
are indistinguishable until something fails in production.

- Release notes: [`docs/releases/`](releases/)
- Event fixtures: [`tests/fixtures/events/`](../tests/fixtures/events/)
- Deployment manifests: [`scripts/`](../scripts/)
- Golden tests: [`tests/compatibility/`](../tests/compatibility/)

## Change classes

Every change to a contract crate falls into exactly one class. The class
determines what the release must carry and who has to approve it.

### 1. ABI

The set of public entry points and their signatures.

| Change | Class |
|---|---|
| Adding a new entry point | **Additive** |
| Adding a parameter to an existing entry point | **Breaking** |
| Removing or renaming an entry point | **Breaking** |
| Changing a parameter or return type | **Breaking** |
| Reordering parameters | **Breaking** |

Soroban dispatches by function name and positional arguments. A caller built
against the old signature does not fail to compile — it fails at invocation, in
production.

### 2. Storage

Keys in `DataKey` and the types they hold.

| Change | Class |
|---|---|
| Adding a new key variant | **Additive** |
| Adding a field to a stored struct | **Breaking** |
| Removing or renaming a key variant | **Breaking** |
| Changing a stored type | **Breaking** |
| Changing a TTL constant | **Semantic** |

Adding a field to a stored struct is breaking, not additive: existing entries
were serialised without it and will fail to decode. There is no migration
mechanism in these contracts, so a storage change means redeployment and
off-chain trust migration. See
[#12](https://github.com/veridatum-labs/earnproof-contracts/issues/12).

### 3. Events

Topics and payload fields. The published shapes live in
[`tests/fixtures/events/`](../tests/fixtures/events/), whose `compatibility`
field classifies each change.

| Change | Class |
|---|---|
| Adding a new event | **Additive** |
| Adding a payload field | **Additive** — indexers ignoring unknown fields stay compatible |
| Removing or renaming a topic or field | **Breaking** |
| Changing a payload field type | **Breaking** |
| Adding a second indexed topic | **Breaking** — breaks topic-arity filters |

### 4. Errors

Panic messages and the conditions that trigger them.

| Change | Class |
|---|---|
| Adding a new rejection condition | **Semantic** — previously accepted calls now fail |
| Removing a rejection condition | **Semantic** — previously rejected calls now succeed |
| Changing a panic message | **Additive** |

Changing a message is only additive because panic strings are not a stable
interface: a cross-contract rejection surfaces as `Error(WasmVm, InvalidAction)`
and the message reaches the caller only through the diagnostic log. Consumers
must not match on them. Typed errors are
[#10](https://github.com/veridatum-labs/earnproof-contracts/issues/10).

### 5. Authorization

Who may call an entry point.

| Change | Class |
|---|---|
| Tightening a requirement | **Breaking** — a caller authorised yesterday is not today |
| Relaxing a requirement | **Semantic** — and a security decision |
| Changing which address is checked | **Breaking** |

Every authorization change is a security change. Relaxing one is never routine,
even though it breaks no caller.

### 6. Resource

CPU instructions, memory, and ledger footprint.

| Change | Class |
|---|---|
| Any measurable increase | **Semantic** |
| An increase that pushes an operation past network limits | **Breaking** |

A contract that exceeds a resource limit is unusable regardless of its ABI.
There are no budget regression gates yet —
[#19](https://github.com/veridatum-labs/earnproof-contracts/issues/19) — so
resource impact is currently assessed by hand and stated in the release note.

### 7. Semantic

Behaviour changes with no interface change: the same call, a different outcome.

Always requires an explicit note. This class is the most dangerous precisely
because nothing in the type system or the ABI surfaces it. A consumer's tests
keep passing while the meaning underneath has moved.

## Classification summary

| Class | Consumer action | Governance |
|---|---|---|
| **Additive** | None; deploy at will | Normal review |
| **Semantic** | Read the release note; retest affected flows | Normal review + explicit note |
| **Breaking** | Update integration before the new artifact is used | Explicit governance (below) |

When a change spans several classes, the strictest applies.

## Release requirements

Every release note in [`docs/releases/`](releases/) records:

| Field | Why |
|---|---|
| `release` | Identifier, e.g. `v0.1.0` |
| `date` | ISO-8601 date |
| `commit` | Full 40-character source commit |
| `toolchain` | Rust channel and `soroban-sdk` version |
| `contracts[].version` | Crate version per contract |
| `contracts[].wasm_sha256` | SHA-256 of the built artifact |
| `changes[]` | Each change with its class and rationale |
| `migration` | Required steps, or an explicit "none" |
| `backend_compatibility` | Minimum backend version, or "unchanged" |
| `rollback` | How to revert, or why it is not possible |

An artifact whose declared metadata does not match its manifest is rejected by
`scripts/verify-manifest.ps1 -Release`. Recording a hash is not enough; the
recorded hash has to be the deployed one.

### What a release note must never contain

- Admin secret keys or seed phrases
- Signing material of any kind
- Private RPC endpoints, API keys, or credentials
- Internal infrastructure hostnames or addresses
- Deployer account secrets

Contract IDs, public Stellar addresses, WASM hashes, and transaction hashes are
public ledger data and belong in the note. The distinction is not "sensitive
versus not" but "already public versus not" — a release note is published, and
publication is irreversible.

`scripts/verify-manifest.ps1 -Release` scans for credential-shaped material and
fails on a match, so the rule is enforced rather than merely stated.

## Breaking-change governance

A breaking change requires all four of the following **before** the artifact is
deployed anywhere consumers can reach it:

1. **Approval** from a maintainer listed in [`MAINTAINERS.md`](../MAINTAINERS.md),
   recorded in the release note by name.
2. **A migration plan** — the exact steps a consumer takes, or an explicit
   statement that none is possible and what that costs them.
3. **A rollback plan** — how to return to the previous artifact, or why it is
   irreversible. "Redeploy the old WASM" is only a rollback if state is
   compatible; if it is not, say so.
4. **Containment notes** — what an operator does if the change misbehaves in
   production. Usually `pause()` on `protocol-config`, but a change to the pause
   path itself needs a different answer, and that answer belongs here.

A release note claiming a breaking change without all four is incomplete, and
`verify-manifest.ps1 -Release` fails on it.

### Why rollback is hard here

These contracts have no upgrade mechanism. A "rollback" means deploying the
previous WASM to a **new** contract ID and re-pointing every consumer, because
the old ID keeps running the new code. State does not travel with it.

That is the real cost of a breaking change in this repository, and it is why the
governance bar is set where it is.

## Versioning

Contract crate versions follow semver, interpreted against the classes above:

- **Patch** (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`) — additive changes only.
- **Minor** (`0.1.0` → `0.2.0`) — semantic changes.
- **Major** (`0.1.0` → `1.0.0`) — any breaking change.

Contracts version independently. A release may bump one and leave the others
untouched; the release note lists each contract with its own version and hash.

## Backend compatibility

The backend depends on contract behaviour in three ways, and each has a distinct
failure mode:

1. **Invocation** — entry-point names and signatures. An ABI change breaks
   anchoring at the point of submission.
2. **Hashing** — it computes `proof_id_hash`, `commitment_hash`, and
   `metadata_hash`. The contracts treat these as opaque and never verify their
   construction, so a hashing change is invisible on-chain until proofs stop
   matching. Vectors are unpublished —
   [#43](https://github.com/veridatum-labs/earnproof-contracts/issues/43).
3. **Schema versions** — it submits a version the protocol must have approved.

Every release states a minimum backend version or "unchanged". A release that
changes any of the three and claims "unchanged" is wrong, and it is the kind of
wrong that surfaces as a production outage rather than a failed build.

## Maintenance

- Adding a change class: update the tables above and the validation in
  `verify-manifest.ps1`.
- Cutting a release: copy [`docs/releases/TEMPLATE.md`](releases/TEMPLATE.md),
  fill every field, then run
  `pwsh -File scripts/verify-manifest.ps1 -Manifest <manifest> -Release <note>`.
- Changing the required fields: update the template, the validation, and
  `scripts/verify-manifest.tests.ps1` together — the tests assert the field set.


## Golden Tests

Contract ABI, storage, errors, and events are captured as golden artifacts in
[`tests/compatibility/`](../tests/compatibility/). These golden snapshots serve
as a machine-readable specification of the stable interface and are compared
against the current implementation to detect breaking changes automatically.

### How it works

1. **Artifacts are captured**: Public functions, storage keys, error codes, and
   event types are listed for each contract in `tests/compatibility/src/artifacts.rs`.

2. **Gates classify changes**: The compatibility gates in
   `tests/compatibility/src/gates.rs` compare the golden artifacts against the
   current state and classify each change:
   - **Breaking**: Function removed, key removed, error code changed, event removed
   - **Additive**: New function, new key, new error code, new event
   - **Semantic**: New error condition, changed behavior without ABI change
   - **Unchanged**: No change

3. **Tests fail on breaking changes**: The test suite in
   `tests/compatibility/src/lib.rs` runs the gates on each contract and asserts
   that no breaking changes are present.

4. **Negative fixtures prove the gates work**: `tests/compatibility/src/negative_fixtures.rs`
   contains synthetic breaking changes that deliberately fail the gates, serving
   as proof that the gates catch real problems.

### Running the tests

```bash
cargo test -p compatibility-tests
```

The test suite runs on every CI build. A breaking change causes the build to fail
with a report showing which contract changed, what was added/removed/changed, and
the classification.

### Updating the golden artifacts

When an intentional breaking change is approved (with governance sign-off per the
requirements above), update the golden artifacts:

1. In `tests/compatibility/src/artifacts.rs`, update the contract's `abi()`,
   `storage_keys()`, `error_codes()`, or `events()` function to include or remove
   the changed items.

2. Re-run `cargo test -p compatibility-tests` to confirm the gates pass.

3. Include the artifact changes in the PR with a clear explanation of which change
   was approved and why.

### Storage encoding snapshots

**Status**: Captured at the type level. The contracts use `#[contracttype]` derive
macros to generate deterministic Soroban XDR encodings. The golden tests verify
that all storage key types are present and accounted for.

Future work ([#18](https://github.com/veridatum-labs/earnproof-contracts/issues/18))
will encode representative storage values as XDR hex blobs and assert that encoding
is stable across toolchain updates.

### Event compatibility

Event fixtures are documented in [`tests/fixtures/events/`](../tests/fixtures/events/)
and tested separately in the [`tests/events/`](../tests/events/) crate.

The compatibility gates verify that:
- No events are removed
- No event topics or fields are renamed
- New events and new fields are tracked

### Why golden tests matter

Without golden tests, a breaking change can slip through review and land in a
release. Downstream consumers only discover it when their anchor daemon fails
in production. The golden tests make breaking changes visible at code review
and CI time, not in production logs.
